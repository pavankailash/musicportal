	<h3>Varnams</h3>
	<p>Varṇam is a form of song in the Carnatic music repertoire consisting of short metric pieces which encapsulate the main features and requirements of a raga. The features and rules of the raga (also known as the sanchaaraas of a raga) include how each note of the raga should be stressed, the scale of the raga, and so on.<br>

	Known for their complex structure, varnams are a fundamental form in Carnatic music. All varnams consist of lyrics, as well as swara passages, including a pallavi, an anupallavi, muktaayi swaras, a charanam, and chittaswaras. There are two types of varnams, known as Taana varnam and Padha varnam.</p>

		<h3>Krithis</h3>
		<p> Kriti (Sanskrit: कृति, krti) is a format of musical composition typical to Carnatic music. Kritis form the mental backbone of any typical Carnatic music concert and is the longer format of Carnatic song. "Kriti" also means Creation.<br>
		Conventional Kritis typically contain three parts

		Pallavi, the equivalent of a refrain in Western music
		Anupallavi, the second verse, which is sometimes optional
		Charanam, the final (and longest) verse that wraps up the song
		The charanam usually borrows patterns from the anupallavi. The charanam's last line usually contains the composer's signature, or mudra, with which the composer leaves their mark.
